	- ### PSK 
		- Pre shared key
	- ### WPA3 
		- fixed the shared hash issue
		- uses the GCMP block cipher mode
		- creates a shared session key without sharing it across the network
	- ### GCMP 
		- Galois/Counter mode protocol
		- stronger encryption that wpa3
		- AES and a MIC built in
	- ### SAE 
		- Simultaneous authentication of equals
		- Diffie-hellman key exchanged with a beautification comonent
		- dif encryption for user but useing the same password

		- central location to track all company assets
- # Video 4.3.1 Vulnerability Scanning
	- ### port scan 
		- shows open ports on a network
		- test from the outside
		- but sould also check inside for inside attacky
	- ### Dynamic analysis/fuzzing

- # Video 4.3.3 Penetration Testing
	- ### Rules of engagement 
		- rules for everyone so they know the scope and reason for the pen test
		- when
		- what internal/external
		- what devices
- # Video 4.3.4 Analyzing Vulnerabilities
	- ### False Positive 
		- false information on vulnerability being marked
	- ### False negative 
		- vulnerability that is actual existent is marked as not
	- ### CVSS 
		- Common venerability scoring system
		- scores vulnerabilities based on severity
	- ### Vulnerability scanner 
		- can scan apps web apps and others
		- firewalls switches
		- can tell you what you can do to fix somtimes
	- ### Exposure Factor 
		- the percetage that the vulnerbility could fail the service
		- a DDoS could limit the service to 50%
		  a buffer overflow could crash the app and take it down 100%  
	- ### Environment variables
		- how important is the device to the network
		- how many users rely on it is it part of the main network?
	- ### Risk tolerance
		- Low tolerence means it needs to be patched
		- high tolerance means meh we can patch other stuff
- # Video 4.3.5 Vulnerability Remediation
	- ### Insurance 
		- offload risk to others
	- ### Ways you can segment a network 
		- physical
		- logical w/ vlans
		- firewalls
	- ### compensating controles 
		- when you cant deploy a patch
		- no internal firewalls
		- you can disable the service or limit external use, or modify the security controls and software firewalls to  block a port that the service uses
	- ### Exception or exemption 
		- when a service can not be patched
		- you want to provide the service but also want to protect the data and systems
		- this will be determined by the severity of the exploit and how it can be exploited
			- for example a user may need to be local to exploit the service
	- ### Validation of remediation 
		- make sure the patch did what it was supposed to do
		- preform a scan of the app to see the change
		- audits can be preformed to check that the patch actauly happened
- # Video 4.4.1 Security Monitoring
-

		- an agentless is a app that is temperarily installed during a certian process not on the machien the whoel time
	- ### DLP 
		- Data loss prevention
		- make sure data like socials credits and what not are not leaking
		- use multiple enpoints and collaborative tools to monitor the data leaving

		- you can root out fake devices by sending i regular poll requests
		- communicates over 162/udp
		- if the CRC error increases by 5 send a trap
	- ### NetFlow 
		- A standard for monitoring data on a network
		- ususaly included in hardware like switches or routers
		- Some agents have comparability with it as well

		- tells who can send mail on your behalf
		- This information is held in a TXT record
	- ### DKIM 
		- Domain Keys identified mail
		- Digitally sign all outgoing mail
		- Mail Gateway can query this signature to be sure that the mail actually came from where it says

			- XDR monitors multiple devicesty
- # Video 4.6.1 Identity and Access Management
	- ### IAM 
		- identity and access management
		- give the correct accsess to the user
		- revoke the correct access from the user
	- ### Identity proofing 
		- the that sould confirm who the user really is
		- background check
		- ask where they use to live and any other identifiable information to prove they are really who they say they are
	- ### SSO 
		- Single sign on
		- one login and you get all resources such as file shares and printers
		- on a timer for a certain amount of time
	- ### LDAP 
		- Lightweight Directory Access Protocol

			- like phone number list
		- has a
		- attribute=value pairs
		- has a directory information tree and any information as a leaf
	- ### SAML 
		- Security Assertions Markup Language
		- Open standard for authenticating and authorization
		- Not compatible with mobile apps/or more than 1 device
		- ### OAuth 
		- authorization framework
		- determines what resources a user will be able to access
	- ### Federation 
		- use authetication without a local database
		- login with Facebook, linkdn, twitter
	- ### Interoperability 
		- make sure resources are all compatable
		- a vpn concentration that has LDAP support and you already have a LDAP server so perfect math
	-
- # Video 4.6.2 Access Controls
- ### Access controls
	- ### least privilege 
		- run with minimal
	- ### MAC 
		- madatory access control
		- every object gets a label
			- confidential, secret, top secret
		- the admin controls what user get to see what tags
	- ### Discretionary Access Control 
		- as the owner you choose who can accsess it
		- google spreadsheet
		- very weak security
	- ### Role-Based access control 
		- RBAC
		- Manager, director team lead and project managment groups
		- the admin assigns the permissions and the users to the groups
	- ### Rule-based access control 
		- the users do not create any thing
		- admins do everything
			- they create a rule and associate it with a object if a user tries to access that object they have to follow that rule
			- example: data in a lab is lab data and can only be access from 5pm to 9pm
	- ### Attribute-based access control 
		- ABAC
		- next generation of a authorization model
		- looks at resource information, ip address, time of day, desired action, relationship to  the data, etc
	- ### Time-of-day restrictions 
		- almost all security devices include a time of day option
		- restricts  access during certain times or days of the week
		- has to account for what time zone the user is in
