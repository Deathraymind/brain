- # Video 2.5.1 Segmentation Access Control
	- ### Physical logical or virtual segmentation 
		- vlans
	- ### security
		- users sould not directly interact with a database server but with a applciation server that interacts wit hthe db
	- ### compliance
		- you may have to comply with rules based on the information you are handling such as pci/credit cards

	- ### Allow list 
		- only things here can be executed

		- patches
		- edr (end point and response)
		- status of firewall

	- ### EDR 
		- end point detection and response/server
		- detects a threat, can have machine learning and process monitoring to find new malware that hasent been seen before
		- investigates using root cause analysis
		- API driven
	- ### HIPS
